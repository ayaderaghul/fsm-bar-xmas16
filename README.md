# fsm-bar-xmas16

# rationale
13/12/16: the old fsm-bar has grown to be too complicated & uncomprehensible after 6 months of not touching it.

so i restart this one. for the phd thesis: evolution of behavior in the repeated nash demand game.

therefore, naturally, this inherits the features & unfinished aims of fsm-bar:

* the data structure of automata is represented in hash table
* immutable mutation
* in interaction, delta is the continual probability
* redo the population (previous: double vectored population)
* mutation: add and delete states
* try to minimize matha in the work flow (export automata code, solve games w matrix form, plot replicator dynamics etc)
* personality test for the automata

## abstract
population of finite state machines playing the repeated nash demand game
a working code

# how to run (tentative)
racket -tm pd-population.rkt

how to extract automata: ... (cont)

## log
13/12/16: copy automata.rkt from fsm-pd2 (racketcon) because the code in that file is less messy
start to work on that file.
